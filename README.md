## Interactive Tree Visualization Tool

This repository implements an interactive tool for visualizing trees, specifically focusing on level-order traversal. Users can create and modify trees, visualize them in a level-by-level layout, and gain a better understanding of tree structures and level-order traversal algorithms.

### Features

* **Interactive tree creation and modification:** Users can build and modify trees by entering values or using drag-and-drop interactions.
* **Level-order visualization:** The tool clearly displays nodes level by level, making it easy to understand the structure and order of the tree.
* **User-friendly interface:** The design is clean and intuitive, with simple controls for interacting with the tree.
* **Built with modern web technologies:** Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for cross-platform compatibility and performance.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/interactive-tree-visualization-tool .git
```

2. **Open the index.html file in your browser.**

### Usage

* Use the input field or drag-and-drop functionality to create and modify the tree.
* Click the "Visualize" button to see the updated level-order representation of the tree.
* Explore the tree nodes and their connections.
